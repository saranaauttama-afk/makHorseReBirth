# 📋 Thai Checkers AI - Progress Log

**Last Updated:** September 25, 2024
**Status:** Phase 3 In Progress - Neural Network Development
**Timeline:** Day 8-10 of 30-day roadmap

---

## 🎯 **What We Built Today**

### **Complete Thai Checkers Game Engine (100% Correct)**
✅ **Fixed Major Misunderstanding:** Started with "knight chess" but correctly implemented Thai Checkers
✅ **8 pieces per player** on dark squares (not 2 knights!)
✅ **Perfect rule implementation:**
- Men move diagonally forward 1 square
- Kings move multiple squares diagonally
- Capture by jumping over enemies
- **Mandatory capture** when available (cannot move other pieces)
- **Chain captures** (2-3+ consecutive captures)
- **King promotion** at far end
- **Visual feedback** (red border for mandatory captures)

### **AI System**
✅ **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**
✅ **4 difficulty levels** (depth 2, 3, 4, 5)
✅ **Proper evaluation function** for checkers
✅ **AI understands all rules** including mandatory capture

### **Mobile App (React Native + Expo)**
✅ **Touch controls** working perfectly
✅ **Move validation** prevents illegal moves
✅ **Game state management** with undo/redo support
✅ **Real-time statistics** (piece count, king count)
✅ **Difficulty selection**

## 🎯 **Tomorrow's Action Plan**

### **Phase 3: Neural Network Development (Day 8-14 of roadmap)**

**Priority 1: Setup TensorFlow.js**
```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native-webgl
```

**Priority 2: Design CNN Architecture**
- Input: 8x8x6 tensor (board state + game info)
- Architecture: Conv2D layers → Dense layers
- Output: Move probabilities + Position evaluation
- Target size: <10MB for mobile

**Priority 3: Generate Training Data**
- Use current Minimax AI to play 10,000 games vs itself
- Save game states, moves, outcomes
- Data augmentation (rotations/reflections)

**Priority 4: Supervised Learning**
- Train initial model on Minimax games
- Target: 60%+ move prediction accuracy
- Validate against held-out test set

- Visual feedback for mandatory capture (red borders) very helpful
- Minimax AI already quite strong for this game
- React Native performance excellent for this type of game

### **Lessons Learned:**
- Always clarify game rules at the start! (knight vs checkers confusion)
- Thai Checkers has more complex rules than expected (chain captures)
- UI enforcement crucial for rule compliance (mandatory capture)
- Mobile performance good even with complex game logic

### **Technical Debt:**
- Could optimize Minimax transposition table
- UI could be more polished (colors, animations)
- Could add sound effects
- Could add game replay/analysis features
